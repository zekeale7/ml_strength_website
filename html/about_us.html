                    We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness industry. Our gym world does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak for themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe
                    that word of mouth has way more credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams up. You are always welcome to look through any of our gyms at your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With hard-selling 'health club' sales
                    consultants hustling you on every corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing change from that. Our 'no obligation, no pressure' attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit rate. We have created gyms that we would love
                    to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an old school feel with a new school attitude!
